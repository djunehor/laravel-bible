## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```

#### Laravel 5.5 and above

The package will automatically register itself, so you can start using it immediately.

#### Laravel 5.4 and older

In Laravel version 5.4 and older, you have to add the service provider in `config/app.php` file manually:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Djunehor\Logos\BibleServiceProvider::class,
];
```
#### Lumen

After installing the package, you will have to register it in `bootstrap/app.php` file manually:
```php
// Register Service Providers
    // ...
    $app->register(Djunehor\Logos\BibleServiceProvider::class);
];
```

## Usage
```php
use Djunehor\Logos\Bible;

$bible = new Bible();
```

$bible->book('John');
$john = $bible->getBook();

$bible->book('Mark');
$bible->chapter(3);
$bible->verse(12);

$lang = 'en';

$bible = new Bible('en'); // use English version
$bible = new Bible('en', 'kjv'); // use English KJV bible

bible('John 3:16');
```

$bible = new Bible(); // lang is set to "en", and version is set to "kjv" by default;
$bible->lang('yo'); // Set language as Yoruba
$bible->version('amp'); // Set version to Amplified Version
```
